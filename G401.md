G4RunManager 唯一强制类

Two kinds of user classes:

- **Initialization class**: used during the initialization phase.
  - Should be directly set to G4RunManager through `SetUserInitialization()` method.
- **Action classes**: used during the run.
  - Should be difined in `G4VUserActionInitialization` class.

GEANT4:

- G4VUserDetectorConstruction

- G4VUserPhysicsList

- G4VUserActionInitialization
  - include at least one **mandatory user action class** `G4VUserPrimaryGeneratorAction`



GEANT4 does not provide default behavior for these classes. G4RunManager checks for the existence of these
mandatory classes when the Initialize() and BeamOn() methods are invoked.

G4VUserDetectorConstruction: define the detector

G4VUserPhysicsList: define the phisics.





Additional five user hook classes:

- G4UserRunAction
- G4UserEventAction
- G4UserStackingAction
- G4UserTrackingAction
- G4UserSteppingAction



G4ParticleDefinition Class : has properties which characterize individual particles.
