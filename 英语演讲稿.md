In 1895, a physicist named Wilhelm Roentgen was doing experiments with a cathode tube, a glass container in which a beam of electrons lights up a fluorescent window.
He had wrapped cardboard around the tube to keep the fluorescent light from escaping,hen something peculiar happened. Another screen outside the tube was glowing.

In other words, invisible rays had passed through the cardboard.

Wilhelm had no idea what those rays were, so he called them X-rays,and his discovery eventually won him a Nobel Prize.Here's what we now know was happening.
When high energy electrons in the cathode tube hit a metal component, they either got slowed down and released extra energy,or kicked off electrons from the atoms they hit,which triggered a reshuffling
that again released energy.
In both cases, the energy was emitted in the form of X-rays, which is a type  of electromagnetic radiation with higher energy than visible light, and lower energy than Gamma rays.

X-rays are powerful enough to fly through many kinds of matter as if they are semi-transparent, and they're particularly useful for medical applications because they can make images of organs, like bones, without harming them,
although they do have a small chance of causing mutations in reproductive organs, and tissues like the thyroid, which is why lead aprons are often used to block them.

X-rays have been used in  so many technology fields.Now in some space technologies, X-rays also present supe-riorities (Economou, 2010). Due to the strong penetrability, X-rays in the  plasma sheath of  the  spacecraft communication blackout nearly have no attenuation. 

When the spacecraft enters into the planetary atmosphere from outer space, a plasma sheath generated by high-speed flight is commonly formed on the entry vehicle surface and disrupts the signal transmission. 

Mars entry vehicles also experience the process, which is called Mars entry blackout (L ́evesque and De Lafontaine, 2007; Wang and Xia, 2015). 

Future Mars missions, such as sample return and manned landing, demand the capability of pinpoint landing at a pre-defined site (Drake et al., 2010; Salotti and Heidmann, 2014). 

However, most of the sensors cannot be worked under the harsh conditions of Mars entry blackout (Li  and Jiang, 2014).  Based on  the high penetration, X-ray signals are expected to enhance the acquisition of positional in-formation for future Mars landing missions. 

The position estimation of all probes which have been successfully landed on Mars is realized primarily with the inertial measurement unit (IMU) based dead reckoning method (Jah et al., 2008; Yu et al., 2017). Nevertheless, previous studies have shown that the positioning error of IMU, even if  corrected through other means before the  Mars entry blackout occurred, while still exceeds a few hundred meters (Li and Peng, 2011).  This increases the  failure risk of  future Mars pinpoint landing missions.

 Moreover, the concept, such as Mars Network, which utilizing the transceiver carried by the entry vehicle to receive the radio frequency (RF) signals from beacons or orbiters has been proposed for achieving the increased accuracy in the landing process (Hastrup et al., 2003; Lightsey et al., 2008). Although this concept is capable to reduce the positioning error, the disruption of RF signals during Mars entry blackout still is a critical issue that needs to be resolved. The aim of this work is to introduce a positioning method which establishes the X-ray signal transmission link between the entry vehicle and orbiters for obtaining the positional information during Mars entry blackout. This paper is structured as followed: Section 2 describes the design and realization of this scheme and introduces the measurement model and X-ray signal transmission link model. In  Section 3,  the attenuation of X-ray signals in Mars entry blackout is estimated. More-over, the positioning performance is evaluated and the influence of X- ray  signal transmission system on  the  positioning error is  analyzed. Finally, Section 4 contains the conclusion and future research directions.
