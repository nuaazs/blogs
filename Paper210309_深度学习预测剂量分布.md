## 介绍

调强放射治疗 Intensity‐modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)已在治疗计划中广泛使用，并可以提供高度保形的剂量分布。

During routine **inverse treatment planning**, planners usually set optimization parameters subjectively based on their experience. Studies have concluded that the quality of IMRT plans varies among institutes and planners. Recently, mathematical algorithms have been developed for knowledge‐based planning and quality assurance (QA) with few manual interventions. The key step of these methods is to predict achievable sparing of organs at risk (OARs) with dosimetric information for an individual patient based on prior knowledge generated from a database of high‐quality treatment plans.

The machine‐learning methods based on several hand‐crafted features have been popular in the literature for predicting the **dose volume histogram (DVH)** or **dose distributions**[14](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mp.13262#mp13262-bib-0014)-[16](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mp.13262#mp13262-bib-0016) . Support vector regression with **principal component analysis（PCA）** has been implemented to predict DVH by establishing the correlation between the features of the DVH and anatomic information.[14](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mp.13262#mp13262-bib-0014) Artificial neural networks have been developed to predict dose distributions for pancreatic(胰腺的) cancer,[15](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mp.13262#mp13262-bib-0015) prostate(前列腺) cancer,[16](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mp.13262#mp13262-bib-0016) and stereotactic radiosurgery(立体定向放射外科).[16](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mp.13262#mp13262-bib-0016) Voxel‐wise dose prediction cannot only generate DVH curves but also give the **detailed dose distributions**. **A potential application is to perform voxel‐wise dose optimization and knowledge‐based isodose manipulation**.[16](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mp.13262#mp13262-bib-0016) Some studies extracted features manually and predicted dose distributions with machine‐learning methods; however, such hand‐extracted features can only capture low‐level information,[17](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mp.13262#mp13262-bib-0017) which may be not sufficient for accurate prediction. More accurate and effective dose distributions prediction needs to be investigated using advanced algorithms.

Here, we developed an intelligent system for predicting optimal patient‐specific dose distributions. It utilized the information of the planning image and segmented anatomy and modeled with a deep learning technique.



## 材料方法

### Patient data and treatment planning.

Eighty patients with early‐stage nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC鼻咽癌) who received simultaneous(同时发生的) integrated boost (SIB) radiotherapy between 2011 and 2016 were enrolled in this study.

Patients were immobilized (使固定) with a thermoplastic(热塑性塑料) mask in the supine(仰卧的,向后靠的) position. Simulation CT images (slice thickness, 3 mm; 512 × 512 matrix) were acquired using a Somatom Definition AS 40 (Siemens Healthcare, Forchheim, Germany) or a Brilliance CT Big Bore (Philips Healthcare, Best, the Netherlands) system.

Radiation oncologists(肿瘤学家) delineated(勾画,描述) the gross tumor volume of the nasopharynx (GTVnx), gross tumor volume of the metastatic lymph node (GTVnd), clinical target volume (CTV), and OARs in the planning CT. 

A margin of 3 mm was applied around the GTVnx and CTV to create the planning GTVnx (PGTVnx) and planning target volume (PTV), respectively. The 16 OARs that we contoured are shown in Table [1](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mp.13262#mp13262-tbl-0001). The protocol of NPC radiotherapy in our department employs a two‐phase SIB strategy.[30](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mp.13262#mp13262-bib-0030) In the present study, only phase‐one SIB planning was used. The union of PGTVnx and GTVnd was named as Boost_all. The prescription to the Boost_all was 70 Gy in 33 fractions (2.12 Gy per fraction). The radiation dose to the PTV was 60 Gy in 33 fractions (1.82 Gy per fraction).

The radiotherapy plans were optimized and calculated in the Pinnacle 8.0–9.10 treatment planning system (Philips Radiation Oncology Systems, Fitchburg, WI, USA). 

All plans were generated using equally spaced nine fixed coplanar 6 MV photon beams with step and shoot. Dosimetric objectives of target volumes and OARs for direct optimization of machine parameters are listed in Table [1](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mp.13262#mp13262-tbl-0001). The final dose grid resolution was 0.4 × 0.4 cm in the TPS and interpolated into the same pixel size with the corresponding CT image.

The final contours and treatment plans were reviewed carefully and approved by our Head and Neck Cancer Radiotherapy Team, which comprised of 10–20 radiation oncologists with average 15 yrs’ of practice.

### The prediction model using convolutional neural networks

We proposed an intelligent system based on CNN to predict the 3D dose distribution.

The inputs were the images with structures, and the outputs were the corresponding dose distribution maps. Due to the limited number of datasets available, we used transfer learning to fine‐tune a CNN model with ResNet101.[31](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mp.13262#mp13262-bib-0031) The model was pretrained on a large dataset (ImageNet).

### Data preparation

In order to learn enough information for accurate dose prediction, we generated novel inputs and outputs for the deep learning network (Fig. [1](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mp.13262#mp13262-fig-0001)). The inputs were the images with structures (named as “SImg” hereafter), with each target and OAR assigned a unique label. The outputs were the corresponding dose maps.

#### Inputs generation

Two types of inputs were used in the model building. 

The performance from each was evaluated and compared. The first type of inputs was named as “**general SImg**” (g_SImg) hereafter. It was the **images with associated contoured structures.** There were 19 regions of interest (ROIs), including 17 OARs and 2 targets contoured on the planning CT of all the cases. Each ROI was assigned a unique label as shown in Table [1](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mp.13262#mp13262-tbl-0001). 

The overlap of the OAR and target was labeled with their summation, which was also unique. The second type of input involved modifying the image gray labels with information from **radiation beam geometry** (named as “o_SImg” hereafter). 

**The distance to the boundary of the beam fields is an important feature for dose distributions because the dose outside of the fields drops off rapidly**. Specifying the out‐of‐field voxels can achieve more accurate prediction.[11](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mp.13262#mp13262-bib-0011) We created the o_SImg from g_SImg by adding out‐of‐field labels according to Eq. [1](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mp.13262#mp13262-disp-0001). To assign a unique label for each ROI of o_SImg, the labels on all the slices beyond the beam fields were added by 100 and increased additional 20 per slice from the boundary.

where *z* is numbers of the slice to the boundary of the beam fields in the superior–inferior direction.

#### Outputs generation

The outputs were the corresponding 2D dose maps. The original **fine dose maps (FDM)** in these cases had gray values ranged from about 0 cGy to ≈7500 cGy, so there were ≈7500 levels which were too many for pixel‐wise prediction. For efficiency and accuracy, a **coarse dose map (CDM)** calculated according to Eq. [2](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mp.13262#mp13262-disp-0002) was used in the present study.

![](https://shengbucket.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/pics/F7A2g.jpg)

where 7500 was about the maximum value of FDM and *l* was the number of levels. The *l* used in this study was set to **256** according to the preliminary experiments (the details of which are presented in the Section [4](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mp.13262#mp13262-sec-0016)).

During the training phase, the CDM calculated from FDM was used to build the model. Accordingly, the proposed system predicted the CMD first during the test phase. The final predicted dose distributions were the FDM converted from CMD by convolving with a Gaussian low‐pass filter [Eq. [3](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mp.13262#mp13262-disp-0003)].

#### Architecture of the proposed system

The proposed system was an end‐to‐end framework used to predict achievable dose distributions based on ResNet101.[31](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mp.13262#mp13262-bib-0031) At the end of the networks, we replaced the fully connected layers with fully convolutional layers for this task. With this adaptation, the networks could predict pixel‐wise dose distributions. ResNet101 consisted of 101 weight layers with small convolution filters and two max pooling operations. There was a batch‐normalized (BN) operation following each convolution layer[32](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mp.13262#mp13262-bib-0032), [33](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mp.13262#mp13262-bib-0033) BN acts as a regularizer to normalize the features, which allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. Then, an element‐wise, rectified‐linear nonlinearity maximum (0, x) was applied to avoid linear equations. Networks with very deep layers are difficult to train due to vanishing gradients. To resolve this problem, ResNet101 used “shortcut connections” to add their outputs to the outputs of the stacked layers.[31](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mp.13262#mp13262-bib-0031) It took a standard feed‐forward convolutional network and added skipped connections that bypassed a few convolutional layers at a time.



####  Experiments

Seventy of the eighty cases were chosen randomly as a training set to adjust the parameters of the dose distributions prediction model. 

The remaining ten cases were used as the test set to evaluate its performance.

 **The input was the SImg with a unique label for each ROI and the output was CDM with 256 dose levels.** 

We implemented the training and testing using Caffe.[34](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mp.13262#mp13262-bib-0034) All computations were undertaken on a personal computer with an Intel® Core i7 processor (3.4 GHz) and a Titan X graphics card. For these experiments, we used the parameters from the corresponding model pretrained on a large database (ImageNet) for initialization.[35](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mp.13262#mp13262-bib-0035) Normally, the input channel of the conv1 layer should be 3 since it was pretrained on ImageNet. However, our input was the gray image of structure images, which has only one channel. We solved this problem by taking only the first channel of each filter in the “Conv1” pretrained on ImageNet when loading the model. Then, we fine‐tuned the entire network for dose distributions prediction tasks[36](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mp.13262#mp13262-bib-0036), [37](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mp.13262#mp13262-bib-0037) We adopted data‐augmentation methods such as random cropping and left‐right flipping to reduce overfitting.[38](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mp.13262#mp13262-bib-0038) We used stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with momentum to optimize the loss of function. Four main hyperparameters were set during model training.[39](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mp.13262#mp13262-bib-0039) A batch size of 1 was used due to the limitations of GPU memory. The learning rate determines how much an updating step influences the current weights and was set initially to 0.001 in the present study. The momentum was set to 0.9. The weight decay factor governs the regularization term of the neural net for avoiding overfitting and was set to the default value of 0.0005. The loss function was computed with “SoftmaxWithLoss” built‐in Caffe. We trained our model by 50k iterations and then evaluated the model using the test set.

### Quantitative evaluation

The accuracy of predicted dose distributions was evaluated against the corresponding ground truth (GT) voxel‐by‐voxel in the range of the body and normal tissue (NT) which was defined as body excluding PTV. The voxel‐based mean absolute error (MAE) was calculated using Eq. [4](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mp.13262#mp13262-disp-0004):

A global 3D gamma analysis was used to evaluate the accuracy of the predicted dose distributions of each OAR. The agreement was assessed at tolerance levels of 3%/3 mm and 4%/4 mm for the *γ* ≤ 1 test.

To evaluate the accuracy of the predicted DVH, the MAE of DVH (MAEDVH) of each OAR was used to calculate the difference between predicted and GT dose‐percent‐volume parameters from D99% to D1% according to Eq. [5](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mp.13262#mp13262-disp-0005):

## Results

The result obtained from the input with radiation geometry was better for slices out‐of‐field (Fig. [2](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mp.13262#mp13262-fig-0002)). The predicted in‐field dose distributions with both types of inputs were quite similar to the GT.

![](https://shengbucket.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/pics/1dnJk.jpg)

The overall mean MAEbody with both types of inputs were comparable (5.5 ± 6.8% vs 5.3 ± 6.4%, *P* *=* 0.181). As for slices out‐of‐field, the result obtained from the input of o_SImg was significantly better (4.7 ± 6.1% vs 5.5 ± 7.9%, *P* = 0.048), while the improvement for the in‐field slices was not significant (*P* = 0.236).

The mean Gamma pass rates with two types of inputs were comparable for most OARs (Table [2](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mp.13262#mp13262-tbl-0002)). However, the mean pass rates for the bilateral optic nerves and the optic chiasm predicted with o_SImg were significantly higher than g_SImg (*P* < 0.05). For the bilateral lens, the mean pass rate also improved obviously with o_SImg, which was 10.1% with 3 mm/3% criteria, and 3.9% with 4%/4 mm criteria. However, not all the improvements were significantly different.



The mean pass rates of all ROIs with o_SImg were 86.4% with 3 mm/3% criteria and 94.6% with 4%/4 mm criteria, which were 3.3% and 1.4% higher than g_SImg, respectively. For each ROI, prediction with o_SImg had mean pass rates higher than 86% using 4%/4 mm criteria and 74.7–98.5% using 3%/3 mm criteria.

The predicted mean DVH of the bilateral optic nerves and the optic chiasm with g_SImg had some differences from GT (Fig. [3](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mp.13262#mp13262-fig-0003)). For these ROIs, the mean MAEDVH with g_SImg was 2.4–6.9 times greater than o_SImg (Table [3](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mp.13262#mp13262-tbl-0003)). For all the ROIs, the mean DVHs with o_SImg were quite similar to the GT (Fig. [3](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mp.13262#mp13262-fig-0003)), and the mean MAEDVH for each ROI were ranged from 0.5% to 2.6% (Table [3](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mp.13262#mp13262-tbl-0003)).
